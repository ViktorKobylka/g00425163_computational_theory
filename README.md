# Computational Theory Assessment – SHA-256

**Author:** Viktor Kobylka G00425163 
**Module:** COMPUTATIONAL THEORY  
**Institution:** ATU  

This repository contains a complete implementation and explanation of key
components of the Secure Hash Standard (SHA-256) as part of a Computational
Theory assessment.

The work follows the official Secure Hash Standard (FIPS 180-4) and demonstrates
both theoretical understanding and practical implementation of cryptographic
hash functions.
